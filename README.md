# AI-Travel-Planner
An AI-powered Travel Planner built with React and Flask. It uses a Kaggle dataset of Indian tourist attractions to rank and recommend places using interest matching, rating-based scoring, and budget constraints. The app generates a day-wise itinerary, shows estimated cost breakup, and provides Google Maps navigation links.
